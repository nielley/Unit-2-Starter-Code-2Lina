        <h2>It is estimated that between 60 and 100 million homeless cats live in the U.S. Since feral cats, like those who share our homes with us, are domesticated, they depend on humans to feed, water, and shelter them and to keep them safe from harm. Feral cats live short, hard lives on the streets.</h2>

                 <p>If you feel safe, approach the cat slowly and speak in a soft voice. Hold out your hand and call it softly. Offer a can of tuna or cat food, a bowl of water and shelter, if possible. But don't force it.</p>
